  {
    // variant styles
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground',
        destructive: 'bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground',
        // ...

        sm: 'h-9 rounded-md px-3',
        // ...
      },
    },
  }
);

interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}

const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
  const { className, variant, size, ...rest } = props;
  return (
    <button
      className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}

      {...rest}
