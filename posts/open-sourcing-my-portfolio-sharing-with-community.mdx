## How to Use and Customize  Portfolio
You can get started with my open-source portfolio by cloning the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hasseebmayo). Follow the instructions provided in the repo to install the necessary dependencies.

## Customizing Your Experience
To update your experience section:
* Navigate to the experience.ts file.
* Modify the content according to your personal experience

For education details:
* Go to the */(portfolio)/education.tsx* file.
* Update the information as needed.

To adjust your skills:
* Edit the relevant sections in the skills file */(portfolio)/Skill.tsx* .


## Adding Blog Posts
* Go to the posts folder.
* Create a new MDX file. The title of this file will be used as the slug for the post and you can also date to track the file published date.
* Include an image, title, and description for the post. These will be used to generate dynamic previews when sharing the link
see the below example code.
